# arubaCentral_renameAPs

A tool that takes the exported list from Aruba Central and renames devices based on a secondary sheet provided. Used with the Central API, it greatly reduces the time it takes to initally configure many APs into central. 


Improvements:
- Create a frontend to remove print statements
- Expand functionality to not just renaming but changing other values
